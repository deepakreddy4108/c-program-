#include<stdio.h>
science= float(input("Enter the marks in Science: "))
history = float(input("Enter the marks in History: "))
maths = float(input("Enter the marks in Mathematics: "))
language = float(input("Enter the marks in Language: "))

calculate the total and aggregate
total = science + history + maths + language
aggregate = total / 4

determine the grade obtained by the student
if aggregate >= 75:
    grade = "Distinction"
    if science >= 50 and history >= 50 and maths >= 50 and language >= 50:
    grade += " with All Pass"
elif aggregate >= 60:
    grade = "First Class"
    if science >= 50 and history >= 50 and maths >= 50 and language >= 50:
    grade += " with All Pass"
elif aggregate >= 50:
    grade = "Reappear"
else:
    grade = "Fail"

display the results
print("Total =", total)
print("Aggregate =", aggregate)
print("Grade =", grade)
